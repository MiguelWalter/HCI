            <h3>Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction</h3>
            <p>HCI (Human Computer Interaction) is a field of study that refers to communication between the human user and a computer system. Here interface refers to a medium or interaction between the computer and the end user. It is also known as CHI (Computer Human Interface) or MMI (Man Machine Interaction). It is concerned with design, evaluation, and implementation. It is used to provide a user-friendly environment.
			
	</p>
	<p><b>
	Important Topics for Human Computer Interaction (HCI)</p></b>
		<p>Objective</p>
		<p>Computer Science</p>
		<p>Cognitive Psychology</p>
		<p>Fine arts design</p>
		
	<p><b>Objective</p></b>
	<p>Human uses digital devices to perform various activities. HCI is to design a systems in such a way that make them efficient, stable, usable and attainable. Lack of communication can result in poor designed user interfaces. It provides a ways to reduce design time through various task models. There are some disciplines contributing to HCI.
	</p>
	<p><b>Computer Science</p></b>
	<p>Computer science is a field of computation and information. Computer science plays a crucial role in modern development of HCI. Smart Television, Voice assistant, AR/VR technology and gaze detection are some of the technology exists in modern world, that are running our day to day life.</p>
	<p><b>Cognitive Psychology</p></b>
	<p>It is a field of HCI which identifies how human interact with systems. It includes Language based interaction, a set of rules are provided to the system. Based on that rules we create our model. It also includes Human motor skills, where we identifies physical characteristics of user and based on that characteristics we create our model.</p>
	<p><b>Fine arts design</p></b>
	<p>An artistic way of thinking always produce creative ideas. E-books and novels, digital drawings, video games are some of the applications of fine arts contributing to HCI.</p>

            <h3>User Experience Design</h3>
            <p><b>What is User Experience (UX) Design?</p></b>
	<p>User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. UX design involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function.</p>
	<p>Designing an experience includes not only making the software easy to use but also designing the other experiences related to the product, for example, the marketing campaign, the packaging and after-sales support. Most importantly, UX design is concerned with delivering solutions that address pain points and needs. After all, no one will use a product that serves no purpose.</p>

            <h3>Usability Testing Methods</h3>
            <p><b> Formative Usability Testing</p></b>
 <p>Purpose: Conducted early in the design process to gather feedback and improve the system.</p>
 <p>Approach: Observing users performing tasks and collecting feedback.</p>
 <p><b> Summative Usability Testing</p></b>
 <p>Purpose: Done at the end of the design process to assess overall system effectiveness.</p>
 <p>Approach: Collecting data on task performance, errors, and satisfaction.</p>
 <p><b> Remote Usability Testing</p></b>
 <p>Purpose: Users perform tasks in their natural environment.</p>
 <p>Approach: Conducted remotely, often using screen recording and monitoring software.</p>
 <p><b>Think-Aloud Protocol</p></b>
 <p>Purpose: Helps understand user thought processes during task execution.</p>
 <p>Approach: Users verbalize their thoughts as they perform tasks.</p>
 <p><b> A/B Testing</p></b>
 <p>Purpose: Compares two different versions of a product to see which performs better</p>.
 <p>Approach: Users interact with different versions, and data is collected on performance.</p>
 <p><b> Heuristic Evaluation</p></b>
 <p>Purpose: Evaluates interface usability based on established principles.</p>
 <p>Approach: Usability experts review the system against predefined heuristics (e.g., Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics).</p>
 <p><b> Surveys and Questionnaires</p></b>
 <p>Purpose: Collect quantitative and qualitative feedback from users.</p>
 <p>Approach: Structured surveys after task completion to gather user satisfaction data.</p>
 <p><b>Eye-Tracking</p></b>
 <p>Purpose: Tracks where and how long users focus on certain parts of the interface.</p>
 <p>Approach: Using eye-tracking technology to analyze user attention and identify interface issues.</p>

            <h3>Interaction Design Fundamentals</h3>
            <p><b> User-Centered Design (UCD)</p></b>
<p>Focus: Design based on the needs, preferences, and behaviors of users.</p>
<p>Key Steps: Research, prototyping, and usability testing to create systems that are intuitive and effective.</p>
<p><b> Affordances and Signifiers</p></b>
<p>Affordances: Visual clues that suggest how an object can be used (e.g., a button that looks clickable).</p>
<p>Signifiers: Indicators or cues that communicate where actions can be taken (e.g., arrows or labels).</p>
<p><b> Feedback</p></b>
<p>Purpose: Provide users with responses to their actions, confirming tasks are being completed or highlighting errors.</p>
<p>Example: A loading spinner when the system is processing a task.
<p><b>Consistency</p></b>
<p>Purpose: Ensure uniformity across design elements (e.g., icons, buttons) so users can predict system behavior.</p>
<p>Example: Consistent color schemes and layout across screens.</p>
<p><b> Constraints</p></b>
<p>Purpose: Limit actions users can take to prevent errors or confusion.</p>
<p>Example: A disabled button that indicates an unavailable option.</p>
<p><b>Usability Heuristics</p></b>
<p>Purpose: Principles for designing user-friendly interfaces (e.g., Nielsenâ€™s 10 heuristics like "visibility of system status" and "error prevention").</p>
<p>Key Heuristics: Simplicity, consistency, feedback, and error prevention.</p>
<p><b> Mental Models</p></b>
<p>Purpose: Users form mental representations of how a system works based on prior experience.</p>
<p>Key: Align the system with users' expectations to minimize cognitive load.</p>
<p><b>Prototyping</p></b>
<p>Purpose: Create early versions of the design to test concepts and get user feedback.</p>
<p>Types: Low-fidelity (e.g., wireframes), high-fidelity (e.g., interactive mockups).</p>
<p><b>Interaction Styles</p></b>
<p>Types:</p>
<p>Direct manipulation: Users interact with objects on the screen (e.g., drag and drop).</p>
<p>Command-based: Users enter commands (e.g., typing text in a search bar).</p>
<p>Form-based: Users fill out forms to interact with the system.</p>
<p><b>Iterative Design</p></b>
<p>Purpose: Continuously improve the design through cycles of testing, feedback, and refinement.</p>
<p>Approach: Repeat testing with real users to refine functionality and experience.</p>
<p><b> Accessibility</p></b>
<p>Purpose: Ensure the design is usable for people with various disabilities.</p>
<p>Key Principles: Provide text alternatives, use color contrast, and ensure keyboard navigability.</p>

        <div class="course">
            <h3>Prototyping and Wireframing</h3>
            <p><b>Wireframing</p></b>
<p>Purpose: Wireframes are low-fidelity visual representations of a user interface (UI) that focus on layout and structure without detailed design elements.</p>
<p>Key Features:</p>
<p>Layout structure: Shows the placement of key elements (e.g., buttons, text, images) on the screen.</p>
<p>Navigation: Demonstrates how users will navigate between different pages or screens.</p>
<p>Functional elements: Indicates where interactive elements, such as buttons, input fields, and links, will be placed.</p>
<p>Types:</p>
<p>Low-fidelity wireframes: Basic sketches or simple digital designs that outline the core structure.</p>
<p>High-fidelity wireframes: More detailed versions that include annotations or basic styling.</p>
<p>Tools: Tools like Balsamiq, Wireframe.cc, and Sketch are commonly used to create wireframes.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<p>Quickly communicates ideas and concepts.</p>
<p>Focuses on user flow and interface layout without distractions from design aesthetics.</p>
<p>Easy to iterate and adjust early in the process.</p>
<p><b>Prototyping</p></b>
<p>Purpose: Prototypes are interactive models of a design that simulate the final product, allowing users and stakeholders to interact with the system.</p>
<p>Key Features:</p>
<p>Interactivity: Prototypes are clickable or interactive, simulating real user interactions (e.g., button clicks, form submissions).</p>
<p>Functionality: Demonstrates how the interface will work in practice, often with dynamic features like transitions or animations.</p>
<p>User flow: Allows designers to test the user's path through different screens or tasks.</p>
<p>Types:</p>
<p>Low-fidelity prototypes: Simple, basic, and quick to create (e.g., paper prototypes, clickable wireframes).</p>
<p>High-fidelity prototypes: Detailed and realistic representations with complete interactions, typically created with tools like Figma, InVision, or Adobe XD.</p>
<p>Tools: Popular prototyping tools include Figma, Axure, Marvel, and Proto.io.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<p>Allows early user testing and feedback to refine the design.</p>
<p>Simulates user interactions, providing insight into potential usability issues.</p>
<p>Helps in communicating functionality and design concepts to stakeholders.</p>
<p><b>Differences Between Wireframing and Prototyping:</p></b>
<p>Wireframing is typically static and low-fidelity, focusing on layout and structure without any interactivity. It's used early in the design process to map out the fundamental elements and user flow.</p>
<p><b>Prototyping is interactive, more dynamic, and can simulate real user interactions. It's often developed after wireframes to test the usability and functionality of the design.</p></b>
<p>Relationship Between Wireframing and Prototyping:</p>
<p>Wireframes serve as the foundation for prototypes. Once the wireframe is developed and refined, it can be turned into an interactive prototype to test and evaluate the design.</p>
<p>Iterative process: Both wireframing and prototyping are iterative. They help designers gather user feedback early and continuously improve the design.</p>
